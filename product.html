<h1 class="prophead">Senior Project Proposal</h1>

<div class="prop">
<p>The topic that I would like to pursue for my senior project is cybersecurity. I decided to choose this project because I am interested in the world of technology and what it has to offer for society. If this is my final topic, I will fulfill my fieldwork requirements by studying and practicing the aspects of cybersecurity through both books and projects.</p>

<p>The interest of cybersecurity came to me when I decided to do my project on something with the relation to technology but pushing myself at the same time. With the resources that I have the ability to use through my father's business I will be able to find a successful and influential mentor.</p>

<p>This project will challenge myself through my knowledge of technology and what I will need to learn to be able to hack and protect certain software and devices. At the moment I have the skills to produce intermediate IT projects but not enough where I can understand the process of securing technology to pursue future interests and opportunities.</p>

<p>For this topic, my final product will consume of visuals and explanations of cybersecurity and how I can pursue these skills in the future. Three product ideas that would benefit my topic include security plans, testing plans and sniffer hacking. Security plans are made up of outlines that are given to different companies so they can secure their data and servers. Testing plans are consumed of white hatters, which are people who get hired from different companies to penetrate and hack into the systems to see if its secure. Sniffer hacking is the process of monitoring and capturing all the packets passing through a given network. It is used by tapping phone wires to receive information from someone else in the same area.</p></div>
