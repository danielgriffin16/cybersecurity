<ul class="aboutM">
	<p>Mike's mission is to help businesses keep their networks safe. The driving force behind Mike's mission is that since we all use the Internet, it should be a safe place to work, learn and play. Being safe on the Internet is ridiculously difficult for non-technical users. This is outrageous, especially with so many businesses and home users relying on the Internet daily. Mike Foster is a Certified Ethical Hacker, Information Systems Auditor, and Information Systems Security Professional. He has delivered more than 1,500 presentations and training sessions in 49 of the 50 United States, plus Canada, Australia, England, Scotland, Ireland, New Zealand, and South Africa. For my senoir project, Mike Foster has provideed me with resources and imformation needed for basic hacking and penetration towards systems, such as servers and software. Mike Foster has been a huge help with pursing my senior project and I am glad to have him as a mentor.</p>
