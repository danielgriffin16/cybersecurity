<ul class="reflection">
	<p>Over the past eight months I have worked on learning the background of cybersecurity and what it truly consists of. The overall project consists of research on the backbone of cybersecurity, how cybersecurity applies to the world today, how companies use testing plans in order to prevent network corruption, learning how to remotely control the operating system and hack into websites. The project itself has been tricky with learning the right type of code to use down to the proper software to download. Once figuring out the right software to use, the practice of hacking into websites was at a start. With the help from my mentor I have learned how to hack into websites “legally” through the use of UBUNTU. This was very interesting to learn and I was excited to see how websites get hacked. This project has provided me with the resources to go forward in the process and pursue cybersecurity as a minor at Grand Canyon University to hopefully lead into a career in IT security.</p>
