<p>Created a web server and downloaded software to start working on the product.</p>

<p>Creating a web server was fun and helpful to learn more about how systems work and run. With the resources my mentor provided me, it gave me a place to start to make the process not as hard. I created it to secure the operating systems.The most challenging part about making the web server was making sure everything would work and I was able to secure my operating systems. My main takeaway from the process of making the server was figuring out how to secure operating systems to prevent attacks while attacking.
The process overall was very helpful for me to be able to take the next step towards hacking. Once finished I felt relieved that I’m getting closer to the end product.</p></div>

<div class="log">
<p>11/21/18 - 11/25/18
	(1.5 Hours)</p>

<p>Looked into practice websites and started to learn the basics of hacking and what I need to do to pursue the product.</p> 

<p>Over the couple days of looking into the practice websites, I learned how the behind scenes of websites run and see how they are put together so I can break into the code. The most successful part of starting to practice on the websites were finding the different ways you can hack into systems and realizing the benefits of learning cybersecurity to hopefully pursue as a career. 
The most challenging part of learning how to white hat, are understanding the background of websites and how to penetrate the system to  find a way into the code.
My takeaway from the days of learning how to penetrate systems were that it is very complicated but in the end will be interesting and beneficial.

<p>Talk to Mike Foster about command prompt and hacking</p>

<p>When talking to Mike about the overall process on how the operating system works I learned that Command Prompt is a vital tool to understand how to remotely control the system. The conversation went really well as I was educated on the type of commands you can use for hacking. It really gave me a new look on how operating systems work. 
The most challenging part was to understand the concepts Mike was talking about since we couldn't see each other in person.
My main takeaway from our conversation was that you can't start hacking without understanding the operating system.
I felt really good after talking to Mike because I had more of an understanding on what to do.</p></div>

<p>Command Prompt wifi Hack</p>

<p>After talking to Mike about Command Prompt, I took what he told me and started to put it to the test. The first thing I did was a Command Prompt wifi hack. This consisted up of accessing the wifi networks I have used in the past and learn how to find the password for the network. I had to type in commands such as “netsh wlan show profiles…key=clear in order to access the wifi password. 
The most challenging part of learning how to access the wifi password was when I had to figure out the right commands to use in command prompt in order to go forward. Once figured out I was in my way. 
My biggest takeaway from learning how to remotely access the wifi networks, was that it may be simple but it can be important for the future if you need to find a wifi password with understanding how the operating system works.
After learning how to access the wifi password I was relieved and excited for what I learned and could not wait to go forward in the project.</p></div>

<p>Command Prompt Remote Shutdown</p>

<p>Today I decided to try a remote shutdown through command prompt to understand more on the basics of hacking. I started by putting in “netstat” to find all the user and local IP addresses that I can use for the hack. One I found the proper IP address, I was able to put it in a table and remotely shutdown either mine or someone else's computer.
The most challenging part of implementing the shutdown, was to find the right IP address to use and to make sure I wanted corrupting or breaking anything within my computer. Once I figured the right way to do it, I was all good to go. 
My main takeaway from today was learning that your computer saves and remembers more than you think and you can use that information to your advantage or just for fun. Such as remotely hacking itself.
Over the time of pursuing the remote shutdown, I learned a lot about how computers work and that you can't just start hacking randomly, you need a beginning and an understanding of what your working on. I learned a lot from today and will be able to use it in the future if needed.</p></div>

<p>Downloaded and installed Ubuntu Software</p>

<p>After learning the basic concepts of hacking and where it comes from, I then decided to get into more difficult hacks. The first thing I had to do was download and install Ubuntu, which can be used to penetrate websites. The download took forever as it took around two hours to complete. Once completed I had to put in commands to install certain software on the system so I can start hacking. One of the programs I had to install was “sqlmap” which consists up of the blueprint of a website that you potentially want to penetrate.
The most challenging part was figuring out which type of Ubuntu to download that wouldn't work. Then installing the right type of software onto Ubuntu. 
My main takeaway from today was that even the basics of cybersecurity can be difficult and complicated to perform but once completed it is satisfying to then be able to start hacking.
I am annoyed on how long it took to get everything downloaded but once completed, I was excited to start penetrating websites.</p></div>

<p>Using the software to penetrate testing sites with the username and password</p>

<p>The first thing I had to do was go online and find a testing website. To make sure it was a testing website, I had to receive an error after putting an apostrophe at the end of the url. Once that was done, I then inserted the url in Ubuntu to start penetrating the website to find the possible login information. I was then able to complete the hack successfully with the help from Mike Foster.
The most challenging part of completing the hack was figuring out what type of commands to put in, so I can find where the username and password would be.
My main takeaway from the experience of hacking was that it can be difficult at times, but when done correctly it is satisfying and makes you want to learn more.
I felt excited about the whole experience and I grew more in learning what truly consists of cybersecurity and how it can be used in many different ways. With hopefully use the skills I learned in the near future.</p></div>

<p>Research and practice on network corruption using Wireshark</p>

<p>After talking to Mike, I was interested in sniffer hacking and breaking into computers through networks. I had to download the program Wireshark which can be used for network corruption. When the program was downloaded I started to look into the background of what a network consists of and how to penetrate it.
The most challenging part of learning how to use wireshark was how to connect to different networks and what commands to put in the program so I can break into networks.
My main takeaway was that network sniffing is a very difficult process and wasn't really my thing at the moment, but will be open to learn more about it in the future. 
I felt pretty confused about the process and the corruption of networks but I learned a lot about how a network is used and what it consists of.

<p>Creating and learning about viruses</p>

<p>Today I learned how to create a virus that could shutdown someones computer. When doing this I learned a lot of new material relating to computer files and how a virus can be created on a computer. Once created I was not able to send it through outlook where someone could potentially click on it and shut down their computer. I was not able to send it through gmail either because there was anti-virus software loaded onto it so viruses couldn’t be sent to someone. So unfortunately it didn't work, but it was really fun to make and learn about.
The most challenging part was figuring out how to not set a virus to my own computer and making sure that it was in a secure place once created. Since it is technically illegal. The having it not being able to send it to someone. 
My main takeaway from today was when I created the virus that i truly realized they are very dangerous, as some can be easy to make through command prompt, while others are very complex and could potentially destroy your computer.
I felt kind of nervous when I started to create my first virus, because I was scared that I was going to mess up and destroy my computer. When I figured it out and was able to attack my own computer without breaking anything and creating a virus to shutdown a computer, I was really excited and relieved. What was disappointed that I couldn’t send it to anyone.</p></div>

<p>Talked Mike Foster and my father about security plans/research</p>

<p>Today I decided to get into the third type of cybersecurity, which is based around security plans. I first talked to my father about security plans and what they consume up of and how they work within businesses and corporation. My father's companies security plan is very complex, so he had a lot to say about them, which gave me some good insight on what they are used for. I then talked to Mike Foster about them and what he uses for his company so they are always secured and up to date.
The biggest challenge when brainstorming and deciding what should be in my security plan, was how much information I need and if I needed to make an annual chart, or just add certain projects and security measures a company should use in their security plan.
My main takeaway from learning about security plans, is that multiple businesses use them and that they are very important to have within a company to keep everything safe and secure.
I felt really good about both conversation  because I learned a lot about security plans are used for and what they consist of to keep a company updated and secure from any potential attacks.</p></div>
