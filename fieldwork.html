<p>8/17/18 - 9/16/18
    (2.5 Hours)</p>

<p>Read the book, “The Secure CEO” by Mike Foster, talking about how cyber security works and what you can do to protect your computer systems and company by using the information it provides.</p>

<p>Over the month of reading the book, it was very helpful and useful to learn the background and basics of cybersecurity. Since my mentor wrote the book, it gave me an idea of what he does to help people with cybersecurity and what he is certified to do.
The most challenging part was figuring out the best way to pursue the “action items” that the book provides, but once figured out, it helped the overall understanding of cybersecurity.
My main takeaway from reading the book, “The Secure CEO” was what cybersecurity is used for and how important it is to the world. Also explaining how I can use it.
I felt really good after reading the book because it provided me with new information about cybersecurity to help me feel more confident on pursuing it and potentially become a career in the future.</p></div>

<p>9/25/18    
    (1 Hour)</p>

<p>Talked on the phone to go over the assignment and figure out what my mentor, “MIke Foster” can do to help me pursue the project cybersecurity.</p>

<p>After talking to Mike Foster about cybersecurity and my project, I learned the basics of what cybersecurity consists of and how to pursue it in the field.
What came off challenging was figuring out how to set up all the software and get it running to be able to start penetrating systems.
My main takeaway from the conversation that Mr. Foster and I had, was what I need to learn and do for the project. I learned that there's a lot to do, but excited to pursue cybersecurity. Overall the conversation went really well and I felt excited to work with Mr. Foster and pursue “white hatting”.</p></div>

<p>11/19/18
	(0.5 Hour)</p>
<p>Created a web server and downloaded software to start working on the product.</p>

<p>Creating a web server was fun and helpful to learn more about how systems work and run. With the resources my mentor provided me, it gave me a place to start to make the process not as hard. I created it to secure the operating systems.The most challenging part about making the web server was making sure everything would work and I was able to secure my operating systems. My main takeaway from the process of making the server was figuring out how to secure operating systems to prevent attacks while attacking.
The process overall was very helpful for me to be able to take the next step towards hacking. Once finished I felt relieved that I’m getting closer to the end product.</p></div>

<div class="log">
<p>11/21/18 - 11/25/18
	(1.5 Hours)</p>

<p>Looked into practice websites and started to learn the basics of hacking and what I need to do to pursue the product.</p> 

<p>Over the couple days of looking into the practice websites, I learned how the behind scenes of websites run and see how they are put together so I can break into the code. The most successful part of starting to practice on the websites were finding the different ways you can hack into systems and realizing the benefits of learning cybersecurity to hopefully pursue as a career. 
The most challenging part of learning how to white hat, are understanding the background of websites and how to penetrate the system to  find a way into the code.
My takeaway from the days of learning how to penetrate systems were that it is very complicated but in the end will be interesting and beneficial.
The whole experience of starting to practice on websites was new and interesting but made me feel grateful that I can now work on pursuing everything I have read and researched.</p></div>
