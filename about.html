<ul class="about">
	<p>I am currently a senior at Mountain Vista High School to finish strong as I embark on the next step in life. I have the passion of faith as I try to reach and change the lives of people through school and life. In the beginning of freshman year I was introduced to the world of technology on a deeper level, then just knowing how to operate your average phone. Over the past three years I have been able to develop the skills of video game design, processing and coding. With using these skills I hope to pursue IT business and eventually work for a large corporation as the Computer Information Officer or start my own business with the relation of technology. I plan to make this dream come true by graduating from Grand Canyon University with a degree of Computer Information Systems and a minor in Cybersecurity to strengthen my knowledge on both business and technology. I believe this is possible because my father has been successful with IT Business by owning his own company and providing a stable homelife for both my sisters and I. Hoping that I can succeed as he did and pursue career fulfillment.
