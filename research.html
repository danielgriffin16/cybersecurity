<p>Security</p></div>
<p>A major problem in the twenty-first century is the lack of security for various nations and their people. Security is used in everything, from one's personal information to the protection of citizens. Even though the world fears the government’s unlimited access to the people, their main intent is protection. Max Anders, once said, “Protection of human life can be costly; but so is the neglect of that protection” (Max n.d.). Freedom and protection from the government are important for the people's safety, however, the oversight of the nation’s privacy within that protection can be harmful. Although people fear government’s access to personal information as an invasion of privacy, the security it provides is worth the intrusion.</p>

<p>Security has been around for centuries because the necessity of national and technological security has increased in the world today. Over time through the invention of currency and the secrecy of information, security has become more important. National security became of even greater importance in the 1940’s when the National Security Act of 1947 was passed. This act recognized the foreign policy and military establishment of the United States Government (National n.d.). As National security became more important and necessary over time, technological security also started to rise. The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network realised IT security became a problem in the 1970’s when the first virus was created and detected (Major 2018). Since then, the use of viruses and malware have improved to penetrate systems and people's personal information. The corruption of operating systems and personal information can be a result of the downfall of both businesses and their clients. A client from ALN Medical Management got hacked by the Russians with the intent of gaining access to medical records which could be used to sell to a third party. Security is becoming more important everyday, proving that it will never disappear due to national threats and new technology being created.</p>

<p>Some feel the information one withholds from the government is the right of being a citizen but when used for harm, it should be available to be accessed if necessary for protection. Personal information is a controversial issue in security; especially how it is monitored among businesses and the government. Manhattan district defense attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., says, “Decisions about who can access key evidence in criminal investigations should be made by courts and legislatures, not by Apple and Google” (Layton 2017). Vance is stating that as technology corporations grow and consume more information from the users, the government should have the right to access personal information if in risk of the security of citizens. CNBC continues to explain the involvement of the government within IT corporations. In the CNBC article, Apple Corporation was involved in a fued with the FBI due to the invasion of privacy for the late shooter Syed Farook. The federal judge assigned to the case asked Apple to help the FBI unlock Syed Farook’s iPhone, since he was responsible for fourteen deaths in San Bernardino. Apple declined to help the FBI, they feared data corruption and defending the civil liberties of their users. The FBI eventually gained access into Farook’s phone to be used as evidence and research on gaining knowledge of the attack, as well as obtaining any accomplices that could potentially cause more harm (Kharpal 2016). Security can be enforced in many ways through the use of technology. The government's involvement in the security of people relies on the surveillance of citizens, which also includes the Transportation Security Administration. The TSA Administrator David Pekoske said, “TSA is working aggressively to raise the baseline for aviation security worldwide because aviation remains a high value target for terrorists. By strengthening the overall security of our commercial aviation network, we are doing our very best to keep flying a secure travel option for everyone” (TSA 2017). The TSA strengthened their security after the 9/11 terrorist attack on the nation. With the advanced security today, this is less likely to happen as people are forced to be searched and scanned for the protection of others. Since the TSA has the ability to invade one’s personal property, they are able to protect people and prevent harm to passengers.</p>

<p>The world is a place of potential destruction, and the government is here to prevent the misuse of information that can be used against their people. Citizens accept the importance of information that is being used as the National Security Agency monitors the activity to prevent national destruction. Former head of the National Security Agency, General Keith B. Alexander, said, “American surveillance has helped prevent potential terrorist events over 50 times since 9/11, including at least 10 homeland-based threats” (Savage 2013). General Alexander proves that national security is an important asset for the government as it can be used to monitor terrorism. One might say the penetration of information without the people knowing is an invasion of privacy and against the law, however the main intent is protection and security. The National Security Agency monitors information among the citizens of the country to be used as a resource for reducing terrorism and threats. For instance, Charlie Savage wrote, “The National Security Agency vacuumed up more than 534 million records of phone calls and text messages from American telecommunications providers like AT&T and Verizon last year” (Savage 2018). The use of phones in this day and age is vital for daily life and is also a resource in ensuring the safety of citizens. The NSA monitors the usage of mobile phones to prevent harm and illegal activity that could be the source of massive catastrophes. This confirms, the National Security Agency is utilizing its citizens information for the greater good of the nation.
Technological security of computers or cybersecurity is a necessity for the growth of the digital world. Security breaches can affect millions of people, as well as their businesses due to the lack of sophistication in security software. Jimmy Spencer reports, “Equifax, the global credit ratings agency who experienced a data breach that affected a staggering 147 Million customers. The costs of recovering from the hack were recently estimated at $439 Million” (Spencer 2018). The corruption of technology can be devastating and expensive to one’s business, however the government's involvement can help to contain and prevent future attacks by providing resources. Cyber attacks have become more common due to the increase in technology and the necessity of software usage. Breaching network security can result in information being sold on the dark web or to a third party for a profit. The use of data can be corrupted from multiple types of technology like phone and computer activity which can be a source of harm. According to Tyler Biscontini from the Salem Press Encyclopedia of Science, Many people save credit card information, photographs, and other important information on their computers. Keeping these machines secure is an important task, but many people fail to do so properly. While malware usually is removed easily, it can lead to a loss of privacy, the deletion of important files, or identity theft (Biscontini 2018). People of the modern age use technology for multiple different reasons, nonetheless they are all at risk of being breached due to the lack of security. Social media and apps make the user provide personal information to the host in order to use their product or service, which can lead to corruption of personal information and potentially identity theft. Since personal information is so accessible, the government has to monitor people's technological activity in order to prevent security breaches from stealing data and information from the user.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, some people believe the government acquires too much control in monitoring the citizen’s personal information. Ron Ross from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, said, “One cannot pick up a newspaper, watch TV, listen to the radio, or scan the news on the internet without some direct or veiled reference to the lack of information security or intrusions into personal privacy” (Ross 2017). Ron Ross is clarifying that citizens are always being monitored and spied on by the government without consent or a warrant. In relation, the fourth amendment states, the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated (LII 2017). This affirms that the government doesn't have the right to invade the privacy of others with no probable cause such as monitoring the legal activities of citizens. This may be true but the information that the government collects from both business and personal data is used to protect and prevent harm among the citizens. For instance, The American Civil Liberties Union wrote, “The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (FAA) gives the NSA almost unchecked power to monitor Americans’ international phone calls, text messages, and emails.” (NSA n.d.). Proving the accessibility that the government has on the people's personal information is legal and to be used as a resource in protecting the citizens from possible threats. Although the actual numbers will be never revealed, there have been at least fifty known attacks on the United States that have been prevented because the government had access to the information needed to thwart these attacks. Thus, proving that the government’s access to its personal citizen’s information, out ways the vulnerability of having personal information exposed.</p>

<p>Citizens have the right to personal privacy, but on the other hand, the government has the responsibility to protect its citizens from both internal and external threats which requires them to have access to the individual's personal information. The government employs thousands of people to monitor the activity of the citizens to detect threats or sketchy activity to prevent damage upon the nation. Without the government's help and resources, the nation would be in chaos and destruction from the lack of security. Security is crucial, even today, as it is becoming more important, proving that it will never disappear due to the new technology being created and the feuds between nations. With the government's role of monitoring the citizens activity and potential damage against the nation, the main intent is protection and the prevention of total annihilation.</p></div>
